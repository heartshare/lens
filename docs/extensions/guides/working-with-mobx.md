# Working with mobx

## Introduction

Lens uses `mobx` as its state manager on top of React's state management system.
This helps with having a more declarative style of managing state, as opposed to `React`'s native `setState` mechanism.
You should already have a basic understanding of how `React` handles state ([read here](https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-state.html) for more information).
However, if you do not, here is a quick overview.

A `React.Component` is generic over both `Props` and `State` (with default empty object types).
`Props` should be considered read-only from the point of view of the component and is the mechanism for passing in "arguments" to a component.
`State` is a component's internal state and can be read by accessing the parent field `state`.
`State` **must** be updated using the `setState` parent method which merges the new data with the old state.
`React` does do some optimizations around re-rendering components after quick successions of `setState` calls.

## How mobx works:

`mobx` is a package that provides an abstraction over `React`'s state management. The three main concepts are:
- `observable`: data stored in the component's `state`
- `action`: a function that modifies any `observable` data
- `computed`: data that is derived from `observable` data but is not actually stored. Think of this as computing `isEmpty` vs an `observable` field called `count`.

Further reading is available from `mobx`'s [website](https://mobx.js.org/the-gist-of-mobx.html).

## Basic usage of mobx:

When using `Lens`'s extension's API, some of the provided types are marked as `observable` (or others) and are documented as such.
These can be used as normal types and the combination of `mobx` and `react` work to determine when a rerender should occur.

## Example:

Imagine that your extension wants to conditionally add an app menu if some other observable value is ever `true` (and remove it when it is `false`).
That could be achieved using roughly the following code:

```typescript
import { LensMainExtension, MenuRegistration } from "@k8slens/extensions";
import observables from "./observables" // a collection of observable data

interface MenuRegistrationWithId extends MenuRegistration {
  id?: string;
}

export default class ExtensionMain extends LensMainExtension {
  appMenus: MenuRegistrationWithId[] = [
    {
      parentId: "file",
      label: strings.extension.appMenu["label"](),
      click() {
        console.log("you clicked the label menu")
      },
    },
  ];

  constructor() {
    super()

    reaction(
      () => observables.clusterIsInState,
      clusterIsInState => {
        if (clusterIsInState) {
          this.appMenus.push({
            parentId: "file",
            label: "Remove from current state",
            click() {
              console.log("currently does nothing, removing...")
            },
            id: "clusterIsInState",
          })
        } else {
          this.appMenus = this.appMenus.filter(m => x.id !== "clusterIsInState")
        }
      }
    )
  }
}
```
